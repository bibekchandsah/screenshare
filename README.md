### Alternative Usage (Advanced)

You can also run the server and client directly if you prefer:

#### Run Server Only:
```bash
python server.py
```

#### Run Client Only:
```bash
python client.py
```

## Network Setup

### For Same PC Testing
- Server IP: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- No firewall configuration needed

### For Different PCs on the Same Network

1. **Find the server PC's IP address:**
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
   - **Linux/Mac**: Open Terminal and type `ifconfig` or `ip addr`
   - Look for the IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

2. **Configure Firewall (if needed):**
   - Allow incoming connections on port 5555 (Desktop) or 8080 (Web)
   - **Windows Firewall**: 
     - Open Windows Defender Firewall
     - Click "Advanced settings"
     - Create new Inbound Rule for port 5555 and/or 8080

3. **Connect:**
   - Desktop Client: Enter the server's IP address when prompted
   - Web Browser: Navigate to `http://SERVER_IP:8080`

## Configuration

You can customize the following settings by editing the source code:

### Main Menu (`main.py`)
- Main entry point for the application
- Handles user interface and navigation
- Imports and runs server, web server, or client based on user choice

### Server (`server.py`)
- **Port**: Change `port=5555` in the `ScreenShareServer` initialization
- **Code Length**: Change `length=6` in `generate_security_code()` method
- **Image Quality**: Adjust `scale_percent` (around line 58) and JPEG quality (around line 64)
  - Lower values = better performance, lower quality
  - Higher values = worse performance, better quality

### Web Server (`web_server.py`) üÜï
- **Port**: Change `port=8080` in the `ScreenShareWebServer` initialization
- **Code Length**: Change `length=6` in `generate_security_code()` method
- **Image Quality**: 
  - Adjust `scale_percent` (currently 100% for maximum quality) in `capture_screen_loop()`
  - Adjust JPEG quality (currently 95 for excellent quality)
  - Line 62-65: JPEG encoding parameters
- **Frame Rate**: Adjust `time.sleep(0.05)` for different FPS (currently 20 FPS)
- **Interpolation**: Uses `cv2.INTER_LANCZOS4` for best quality when scaling
- **Progressive JPEG**: Enabled for better streaming performance

**Quality Settings Explained:**
- `scale_percent = 100`: Full resolution (100% of original)
- `JPEG_QUALITY = 95`: Near-lossless compression
- `JPEG_OPTIMIZE = 1`: Optimize file size
- `JPEG_PROGRESSIVE = 1`: Progressive rendering for web
- `INTER_LANCZOS4`: Highest quality interpolation algorithm

### Client (`client.py`)
- Default port can be changed in the main() function

## Performance Tips

1. **Reduce Screen Resolution**: The server automatically scales to 60% of original size
2. **Adjust Quality**: Lower JPEG quality in `server.py` for faster streaming
3. **Close Unused Applications**: Free up system resources
4. **Use Wired Connection**: Better than WiFi for smoother streaming

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused
- Make sure the server is running before starting the client
- Check if the IP address is correct
- Verify firewall settings
- If using `main.py`, ensure you select option 1 (Share) on server PC first

### Unauthorized Error
- Double-check the security code (it's case-sensitive, but automatically converted to uppercase)
- Make sure you're entering the current code from the active server session
- Verify you're copying the complete 6-character code
- Check debug output to see what codes are being compared

### Poor Performance / Lag
- Reduce the image quality in `server.py` (lower `scale_percent` and JPEG quality)
- Close bandwidth-heavy applications on both PCs
- Check network connection speed
- Use wired Ethernet instead of WiFi for better stability

### Black Screen or No Display
- Verify screen capture permissions (especially on macOS)
- Try running with administrator/sudo privileges
- Check if `mss` library is properly installed
- Ensure OpenCV (`cv2`) is correctly installed

### Application Crashes or Freezes
- Update all dependencies to latest compatible versions
- Check Python version (requires 3.7+)
- Verify all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
- Try restarting both applications

### "Press Enter to continue" Not Working
- This is normal behavior - just press the Enter key to return to main menu
- If stuck, press `Ctrl+C` to force exit

### Mobile Browser Can't Connect
- Ensure both devices are on the **same WiFi network**
- Check Windows Firewall settings (allow port 8080)
- Try accessing with PC's IP instead of localhost
- Verify the URL format: `http://IP:8080` (not https)
- Check if another app is using port 8080

### Stream is Laggy on Mobile
- Move closer to WiFi router
- Close other apps using bandwidth
- Lower quality in `web_server.py` (reduce `scale_percent` from 100 to 75 or 50)
- Use 5GHz WiFi instead of 2.4GHz if available
- Try reducing frame rate (increase `time.sleep(0.05)` to `0.1` for 10 FPS)

### Zoom Not Working Properly
- Make sure you're clicking on the screen image area, not the background
- Try clicking and waiting a moment for the zoom to process
- If zoomed, try dragging to see if pan works
- Refresh the page if zoom gets stuck

### Fullscreen Issues
- **F key not working**: Make sure you're viewing the screen (not on login page)
- **Can't exit fullscreen**: Press Esc key or double-click the draggable F button
- **White screen in fullscreen**: This has been fixed - refresh if you see it
- **F button disappeared**: It might be dragged off-screen - exit and re-enter fullscreen

### Multiple Connection Requests Overlapping
- **FIXED**: Requests are now queued and processed one at a time
- You'll see "Pending requests in queue: X" to know how many are waiting
- Server won't crash if sessions timeout during approval

### Server Crashes on Timeout
- **FIXED**: Added comprehensive exception handling
- Server continues running even if connections timeout
- All resources are properly cleaned up

## üÜò Troubleshooting Remote Access

### ngrok Issues:

**Problem: "Warning page" or "License agreement" shown instead of app**
- **Solution:** This is ngrok's anti-phishing warning (normal for free tier)
- Click **"Visit Site"** button to continue
- Tell viewers to click through the warning
- To skip: Upgrade to ngrok paid plan ($10/month)

**Problem: "Tunnel not found"**
- Solution: Check if ngrok is running
- Verify port number matches

**Problem: "Too many connections" (Free tier)**
- Solution: Upgrade to paid plan or wait

**Problem: Slow performance**
- Solution: ngrok free servers may be far away
- Try different region: `ngrok http 8080 --region eu`

**Problem: Page shows "Oracle Database" or random content**
- **Cause:** You're seeing ngrok's interstitial warning page
- **Solution:** Scroll down and click "Visit Site" button
- This is NOT your application - it's ngrok's security check
- The warning page HTML sometimes shows random cached content

### Port Forwarding Issues:

**Problem: Cannot connect from outside**
- Check router port forwarding rules
- Verify Windows Firewall allows port
- Test if ISP blocks port (some block 80, 8080)
- Try different port (e.g., 8081, 9000)

**Problem: IP address changes**
- Setup Dynamic DNS service
- Check ISP if they provide static IP

### General Issues:

**Problem: Connection very slow**
- Reduce image quality in settings
- Check internet upload speed
- Consider local server closer to viewers

**Problem: Connection drops frequently**
- Check internet stability
- Increase timeout values
- Use wired connection instead of WiFi

---

## üìä Performance Tips for Remote Access

### Optimize for Internet Streaming:

1. **Reduce Resolution** (in `web_server.py`):
   ```python
   scale_percent = 75  # Instead of 100
   ```

2. **Lower Quality** (for slower connections):
   ```python
   int(cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY), 80  # Instead of 95
   ```

3. **Reduce Frame Rate**:
   ```python
   time.sleep(0.1)  # 10 FPS instead of 20
   ```

4. **Monitor Bandwidth**:
   - Check your upload speed: [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net)
   - Required: ~2-5 Mbps upload for good quality

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- This is a basic implementation for educational purposes
- The security code provides minimal security
- **Two-factor security:** Security code + manual server approval
- For production use, consider:
  - SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS)
  - Stronger authentication mechanisms
  - Password protection
  - Connection logging
  - End-to-end encryption

## How It Works

### Desktop Mode:
1. **Server** captures the screen using `mss` library in real-time
2. Each frame is converted to a numpy array and compressed using OpenCV with JPEG encoding
3. Compressed images are serialized with `pickle` and sent over TCP socket
4. **Client** connects and sends the security code for authentication
5. Server asks for manual approval before allowing connection
6. Upon approval, client receives, deserializes, and displays frames continuously
7. Automatic reconnection if connection drops (3 attempts with 2-second delays)

### Web Browser Mode (Mobile-Friendly):
1. **Web Server** captures screen continuously at 100% resolution in a background thread
2. Frames are compressed using JPEG (95% quality) with progressive encoding and optimization
3. Uses LANCZOS4 interpolation for highest quality scaling
4. Compressed frames stored in memory with thread-safe locking
5. **HTTP Server** serves a responsive HTML/JavaScript interface with modern design
6. **ThreadingHTTPServer** handles multiple simultaneous connections
7. Browser connects, displays modern UI with individual digit input boxes
8. Client enters security code, sends via AJAX POST request
9. Server validates code and queues approval request
10. **Sequential Approval Processing**: Requests processed one at a time in order (FIFO)
11. Server asks for manual approval (shows queue status)
12. Upon approval, server sends session ID to browser
13. Browser receives frames via MJPEG streaming (multipart/x-mixed-replace boundary)
14. Client can:
    - **Zoom**: Click any area to zoom into that section (calculates relative position)
    - **Pan**: Drag with mouse/touch when zoomed to navigate
    - **Fullscreen**: Double-click F button or press F key
    - **Exit Fullscreen**: Press Esc key or double-click F button
    - **Move Controls**: Drag F button to any position
15. **Connection Monitoring**: Browser checks `/health` endpoint every 3 seconds
16. **Auto-disconnect Detection**: Shows notification if server disconnects
17. Optimized for mobile with touch gestures and responsive layout
18. 20 FPS streaming for smooth motion

### Security & Threading:
- **Two-Factor Security**: Security code + manual server approval
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All shared data protected with locks
- **Approval Queue**: Sequential processing prevents overlapping prompts
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Proper locking on all pending approvals
- **Graceful Timeout Handling**: Sessions cleaned up properly without crashes
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents server crashes

### Data Flow:
```
Screen ‚Üí mss.grab() ‚Üí NumPy Array ‚Üí cv2.resize() ‚Üí JPEG Encode ‚Üí Memory Buffer
                                                                         ‚Üì
Browser ‚Üê MJPEG Stream ‚Üê HTTP Response ‚Üê ThreadingHTTPServer ‚Üê Memory Buffer
```

### Synchronization:
- **frame_lock**: Protects current_frame buffer during read/write
- **approval_lock**: Protects pending_approvals dictionary
- **approval_queue**: Thread-safe queue for approval requests
- All dictionary operations on shared data are protected
