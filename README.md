   - Wait for approval on PC
   - Enjoy viewing your PC screen on your phone! üì±

### **Firewall Configuration (Important for Mobile):**

If your phone can't connect, you may need to allow the port through Windows Firewall:

**Method 1 - Quick Test (Temporary):**
- Temporarily disable Windows Firewall
- Test if it works
- Re-enable firewall after testing

**Method 2 - Add Firewall Rule (Recommended):**
1. Open Windows Security ‚Üí Firewall & network protection
2. Click "Advanced settings"
3. Click "Inbound Rules" ‚Üí "New Rule"
4. Select "Port" ‚Üí Next
5. TCP, Specific port: **8080** ‚Üí Next
6. Allow the connection ‚Üí Next
7. Check all profiles ‚Üí Next
8. Name: "Screen Share Web Server" ‚Üí Finish

### **Tips for Mobile Viewing:**
- ‚úÖ Use the same WiFi network
- ‚úÖ Use landscape mode for better viewing
- ‚úÖ Enable full-screen in browser
- ‚úÖ Stable connection = smoother streaming
- ‚úÖ Close unnecessary apps on phone for better performance

---

### Alternative Usage (Advanced)

You can also run the server and client directly if you prefer:

#### Run Server Only:
```bash
python server.py
```

#### Run Client Only:
```bash
python client.py
```

## Network Setup

### For Same PC Testing
- Server IP: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- No firewall configuration needed

### For Different PCs on the Same Network

1. **Find the server PC's IP address:**
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
   - **Linux/Mac**: Open Terminal and type `ifconfig` or `ip addr`
   - Look for the IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

2. **Configure Firewall (if needed):**
   - Allow incoming connections on port 5555 (Desktop) or 8080 (Web)
   - **Windows Firewall**: 
     - Open Windows Defender Firewall
     - Click "Advanced settings"
     - Create new Inbound Rule for port 5555 and/or 8080

3. **Connect:**
   - Desktop Client: Enter the server's IP address when prompted
   - Web Browser: Navigate to `http://SERVER_IP:8080`

## Configuration

You can customize the following settings by editing the source code:

### Main Menu (`main.py`)
- Main entry point for the application
- Handles user interface and navigation
- Imports and runs server, web server, or client based on user choice

### Server (`server.py`)
- **Port**: Change `port=5555` in the `ScreenShareServer` initialization
- **Code Length**: Change `length=6` in `generate_security_code()` method
- **Image Quality**: Adjust `scale_percent` (around line 58) and JPEG quality (around line 64)
  - Lower values = better performance, lower quality
  - Higher values = worse performance, better quality

### Web Server (`web_server.py`) üÜï
- **Port**: Change `port=8080` in the `ScreenShareWebServer` initialization
- **Code Length**: Change `length=6` in `generate_security_code()` method
- **Image Quality**: Adjust `scale_percent` (50% for mobile) and JPEG quality (70)
- **Frame Rate**: Adjust `time.sleep(0.1)` for different FPS (currently 10 FPS)

### Client (`client.py`)
- Default port can be changed in the main() function

## Performance Tips

1. **Reduce Screen Resolution**: The server automatically scales to 60% of original size
2. **Adjust Quality**: Lower JPEG quality in `server.py` for faster streaming
3. **Close Unused Applications**: Free up system resources
4. **Use Wired Connection**: Better than WiFi for smoother streaming

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused
- Make sure the server is running before starting the client
- Check if the IP address is correct
- Verify firewall settings
- If using `main.py`, ensure you select option 1 (Share) on server PC first

### Unauthorized Error
- Double-check the security code (it's case-sensitive, but automatically converted to uppercase)
- Make sure you're entering the current code from the active server session
- Verify you're copying the complete 6-character code
- Check debug output to see what codes are being compared

### Poor Performance / Lag
- Reduce the image quality in `server.py` (lower `scale_percent` and JPEG quality)
- Close bandwidth-heavy applications on both PCs
- Check network connection speed
- Use wired Ethernet instead of WiFi for better stability

### Black Screen or No Display
- Verify screen capture permissions (especially on macOS)
- Try running with administrator/sudo privileges
- Check if `mss` library is properly installed
- Ensure OpenCV (`cv2`) is correctly installed

### Application Crashes or Freezes
- Update all dependencies to latest compatible versions
- Check Python version (requires 3.7+)
- Verify all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
- Try restarting both applications

### "Press Enter to continue" Not Working
- This is normal behavior - just press the Enter key to return to main menu
- If stuck, press `Ctrl+C` to force exit

### Mobile Browser Can't Connect
- Ensure both devices are on the **same WiFi network**
- Check Windows Firewall settings (allow port 8080)
- Try accessing with PC's IP instead of localhost
- Verify the URL format: `http://IP:8080` (not https)
- Check if another app is using port 8080

### Stream is Laggy on Mobile
- Move closer to WiFi router
- Close other apps using bandwidth
- Lower quality in `web_server.py` (reduce `scale_percent` or JPEG quality)
- Use 5GHz WiFi instead of 2.4GHz if available

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- This is a basic implementation for educational purposes
- The security code provides minimal security
- **Two-factor security:** Security code + manual server approval
- For production use, consider:
  - SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS)
  - Stronger authentication mechanisms
  - Password protection
  - Connection logging
  - End-to-end encryption

## How It Works

### Desktop Mode:
1. **Server** captures the screen using `mss` library in real-time
2. Each frame is converted to a numpy array and compressed using OpenCV with JPEG encoding
3. Compressed images are serialized with `pickle` and sent over TCP socket
4. **Client** connects and sends the security code for authentication
5. Server asks for manual approval before allowing connection
6. Upon approval, client receives, deserializes, and displays frames continuously
7. Automatic reconnection if connection drops

### Web Browser Mode (Mobile-Friendly):
1. **Web Server** captures screen continuously in a background thread
2. Frames are compressed and stored in memory
3. **HTTP Server** serves a responsive HTML/JavaScript interface
4. Browser connects, sends security code via AJAX POST request
5. Server validates code and asks for manual approval
6. Upon approval, server sends session ID to browser
7. Browser displays frames via MJPEG streaming (multipart/x-mixed-replace)
8. Optimized for mobile with lower resolution and frame rate
3. Compressed images are serialized with `pickle` and sent over TCP socket
4. **Client** connects and sends the security code for authentication
5. Upon successful authentication, client receives, deserializes, and displays frames continuously
6. Security code ensures only authorized viewers can connect
7. **Main Menu** (`main.py`) provides a unified interface to launch either server or client mode
