# Universal Installation & Usage Guide 🌍

## YES! Same Application for Everyone, Anywhere

Your screen sharing application is **perfectly designed** for universal use. The same application works as:

- 🖥️ **Server** (share your screen)
- 👀 **Client** (view someone's screen)  
- 🌐 **Tunnel** (connect over internet)

---

## 📦 How Users Can Get the Application

### Method 1: GitHub Repository (Current) ⭐
**Repository:** https://github.com/bibekchandsah/screenshare

**Installation for any user:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bibekchandsah/screenshare.git
cd screenshare

# Install requirements  
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

### Method 2: Executable Distribution (Recommended) 🚀
You already have `build_exe.py` - create executables for easy distribution:

**For Windows users:**
```bash
# Build executable (you run this once)
python build_exe.py

# Distribute the .exe file
# Users just double-click ScreenShare.exe
```

**No Python installation needed for end users!**

### Method 3: Python Package (Advanced) 📦
Convert to installable package:
```bash
# Users install via pip
pip install screenshare-app

# Then run from anywhere
screenshare
```
