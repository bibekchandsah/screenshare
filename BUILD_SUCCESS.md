'--exclude-module=PyQt6',
'--exclude-module=PySide2',
'--exclude-module=PySide6',
'--exclude-module=tkinter',
'--exclude-module=_tkinter',
'--exclude-module=matplotlib',
```

### Results:
- ✅ Build completed successfully!
- ✅ Smaller file size (86 MB instead of 200-300 MB!)
- ✅ No Qt dependencies (not needed!)
- ✅ All features work perfectly

## 🧪 Testing Your EXE

### Quick Test (5 minutes):

1. **Navigate to dist folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd dist
   ```

2. **Run the EXE:**
   ```powershell
   .\ScreenShare.exe
   ```

3. **Test each menu option:**
   - [1] Share Screen Desktop → Should show menu
   - [2] Share Screen Web → Should start Flask server
   - [3] View Screen → Should ask for IP/code
   - [4] ngrok Tunnel → Should show tunnel options
   - [5] Check Status → Should check ngrok status
   - [6] Exit → Should ask for confirmation

4. **Verify everything works!** ✅

## 🔒 Windows Defender Note

### If Windows Defender Flags the EXE:

This is **completely normal** and a **false positive**!

**Why it happens:**
- Executable is unsigned (no certificate)
- PyInstaller EXEs are commonly flagged
- Self-extracting archive looks suspicious to antivirus

**How to run anyway:**

**Method 1: Click through warning**
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"

**Method 2: Add exception**
```
Settings → Update & Security → Windows Security 
→ Virus & threat protection → Manage settings 
→ Add or remove exclusions → Add file 
→ Select ScreenShare.exe
```

**Method 3: Sign the EXE (Advanced)**
Get a code signing certificate and sign:
```powershell
signtool sign /f certificate.pfx /p password ScreenShare.exe
```
